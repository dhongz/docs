title: "Run in Bulk (Grid)"
description: "To run your workflow in bulk, select `Run in Bulk (Grid)` from the top navigation bar when viewing your workflow. This option automatically creates a grid with all necessary columns pre-configured, including your input columns and workflow column with inputs already mapped. You can then populate multiple rows of data, [run the workflow across all rows](/grids/run-workflows-in-grid) simultaneously, and view results directly in the Grid. This method is ideal when you need to process many inputs at once, saving you the time of manually configuring each run."
