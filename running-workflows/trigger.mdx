Run your AirOps workflows automatically by setting them up with triggers that activate when specific events occur. You can configure custom webhooks to receive data from external services or use the AirOps Zapier app to connect with thousands of other applications. Trigger-based execution enables fully automated workflows that run without manual intervention, perfect for integrating AirOps into your existing systems and processes.
