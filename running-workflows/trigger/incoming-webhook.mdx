## How to Trigger Your Workflow with an Incoming Webhook

### 1. Create a Workflow with one JSON input

To trigger a workflow with an incoming Webhook, first, you need to make sure that your Workflow has one JSON input value:
<Frame>
<iframe
  src="https://demo.arcade.software/c3phBccxDiEZkJjtHpvB?embed"
  title="Arcade demo"
  allowFullScreen
  allow="clipboard-write"
  className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl"
></iframe>
</Frame>

### 2. Publish your workflow

Next, publish your Workflow by clicking **Publish** Workflow in the top right hand corner of the Workflow Studio.

### 3. Configure the Webhook URL

Now, configure your Webhook URL with your [App UUID and API Key](/running-workflows/api):

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url 'https://app.airops.com/public_api/airops_apps/YOUR_APP_UUID/webhook_async_execute?auth_token=YOUR_API_KEY' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "custom_parameter": "Custom Value"
}
'
```

You can now test your API by running the call in Postman or in your terminal. You should see a 200 response, which you can then validate in the Workflow's "History" tab.

Once you have confirmed the Workflow ran successfully, you can copy and paste the resulting Webhook URL to your external service. The URL will look something like this:

```bash
https://app.airops.com/public_api/airops_apps/a3cb8474-9ec1-4052-8c54-7cbcb7a4c846/webhook_async_execute?auth_token=your_workspace_token
```
