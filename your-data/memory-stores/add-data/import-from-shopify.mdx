### Selecting Columns and Searchability

After selecting your data type, you'll need to configure which attributes to include:

- Choose which columns to include in your import (e.g., id, title, handle, description, featuredImage.url)
- Specify which columns should be searchable in your Knowledge Base
- Non-searchable columns will still be included in results and can be used for filtering

### Filtering Your Import

To narrow down which items to import:

- Use filters like Published Status, Status, Tags, Minimum Inventory, Product Type, and Vendor
- Enter specific values for each filter (e.g., specific tags like "blue, summer" or product types like "snowboard, skateboard")
- Preview the filtered results before completing your import
- Click "Continue" to add the filtered Shopify content to your Knowledge Base

Once imported, your Shopify data becomes semantically searchable, allowing your workflows to intelligently select products for custom collections, feature relevant products in editorial content, find related articles for internal linking, and much more.
