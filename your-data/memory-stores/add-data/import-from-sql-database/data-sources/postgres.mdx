**Remember to allowlist our IP Address `52.71.87.39`**

If your database is protected by a firewall, remember to allow inbound access to AirOPs IP address over your database port.

## Add Postgres as a Database in AirOps

To setup a new database connection, go to **⚙️ Settings —> Warehouse Setup —> Add Source**

Then, include the following:

1. **Host** - The hostname or IP address of your PostgreSQL server.
	Example: `example-postgres-instance.abcdefghijkl.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com`
2. **Port** - The port on which your PostgreSQL server is listening. Default is `5432`.
3. **User** - The PostgreSQL user that AirOps will connect to the database with. It is best practice to create a new user for AirOps (instructions below), but any user with SELECT privileges can be used.
4. **Password** - Password for the above user.
5. **Database** - The PostgreSQL database that AirOps will connect to.

## Setup User and Grant Access

To add a PostgreSQL database as a Data Source on AirOps, use an existing user or create a user with **read** access to the tables and schemas you would like to access from AirOps:

### 1\. Create AirOps User

```bash
CREATE USER airops_user
WITH PASSWORD '<secure-password>';
```

### 2\. Grant USAGE and SELECT Privileges

Replace with the appropriate schema and table names that you would like AirOps to interact with.

```bash
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "<schema>" TO airops_user;

GRANT SELECT ON TABLE "<schema>"."<table>" TO airops_user;
```

If you want to grant access to multiple tables, you can run the `GRANT SELECT` statement for each table or run `GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES`.

### 3\. (Optional) Grant Access to Future Tables in Schema

If you want to grant access to all future tables in a schema, you can use the following command, replacing with the appropriate schema name:

```bash
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA "<schema>"
GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO airops_user;
```
