<Info>
**Remember to allowlist our IP Address `52.71.87.39`**

If your database is protected by a firewall, remember to allow inbound access to AirOPs IP address over your database port.
</Info>

1. **Host or IP** - The endpoint of your AWS Redshift cluster. Example: `examplecluster.abcdefghijkl.us-west-2.redshift.amazonaws.com`
2. **Port** - The port on which your Redshift cluster is listening. Default is `5439`.
3. **User** - The Redshift user that AirOps will connect to the database with. It is best practice to create a new user for AirOps (instructions below), but any user with SELECT privileges can be used.
4. **Password** - Password for the above user.
5. **Database** - The Redshift database that AirOps will connect to.

## Setup User and Grant Access (for New Users)

To add an AWS Redshift database as a Data Source on AirOps, use an existing user or create a user with **read** access to the tables and schemas you would like to access from AirOps:

### 1\. Create AirOps User

```bash
CREATE USER airops_user
PASSWORD '<secure-password>';
```

### 2\. Grant USAGE and SELECT privileges to AirOps user

Replace `<schema>` and `<table>` with the appropriate schema and table names that you would like AirOps to interact with.

```bash
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "<schema>" TO airops_user;

GRANT SELECT ON TABLE "<schema>"."<table>" TO airops_user;
```

If you want to grant access to multiple tables, you can run the `GRANT SELECT` statement for each table.

### 3\. (Optional) Grant access to future tables in the schema

If you want to grant access to all future tables in a schema, you can use the following command. Replace with the appropriate schema name.

```bash
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA "<schema>"
GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO airops_user;
```
