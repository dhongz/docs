## What is a Brand Kit?

**Brand kits are portable personas that allow you to centrally store, manage, and update key contextual information for your LLM-powered workflows.** They provide a structured way to maintain and supply essential context about your brand, product, customer, and business, ensuring that any LLM within AirOps has the necessary context to generate content that aligns with your voice and objectives.

By using a brand kit, you can define and improve the a context base that trains the LLM on unique characteristics of your business, ensuring that LLM outputs remain consistent, accurate, and on-brand across different workflows. Brand kits are centrally managed, meaning that as new insights are added—such as frequently asked questions, updated product details, or refined brand messaging—you can update the kit in one place, and all linked workflows will inherit the changes automatically.

Each brand kit includes a default set of structured fields designed to capture core brand attributes. Additionally, you can define custom fields to support unique business needs. These fields can be referenced in their entirity—when applying an entire brand kit to an LLM call—or selectively for more targeted LLM calls.
