## Knowledge Base Search

AirOps' Knowledge Base search feature uses semantic search to find information based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches. When you search, the system returns the most relevant chunks of content from your documents, not necessarily entire files or articles, making it easier to pinpoint specific information.

You can test this functionality using the "Search Test" button for any Knowledge Base you've created, allowing you to see how effectively the system retrieves contextually relevant information from your data. This approach ensures you get precise, focused results that address your query's intent rather than just matching words.

## What is Semantic Search?

Semantic databases differ from normal keyword-based databases like SQL. They return results with the closest semantic meaning, not just exact matches. For example, searching for "vanilla ice cream" would return results like "vanilla icecream, vanilla custard, chocolate icecream, icecream sundae". It's great for retrieval use cases where you want to find content relevant to a particular topic or user request and is the foundation of every single chatbot "trained on your data".
