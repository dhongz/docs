### Mapping Workflow Outputs to a new Column

Mapping the outputs of your Workflow runs directly in the Grid helps you efficiently view and edit them. After a Workflow has successfully run, you can map its outputs by:

- Click the Expand Icon on the Workflow cell (it should say 'Success')
- To add a single output as a Grid column:
  - Hover on the element of the Workflow you want to map to a new column
  - Click 'Add to Column'
- To add all outputs as Grid columns:
  - Click "Add as Separate Columns"

That element of the Workflow output is now automatically added as a new column to your current Grid. The column type will be automatically matched to the output format type.
