### How to Access Run Metadata

When viewing a completed workflow run, you'll see several tabs at the top of the results panel:
<Steps>
<Step title="Output">
Shows the final result produced by your workflow
</Step>
<Step title="Inputs">
 Displays all parameters and values that were used to run the workflow
</Step>
<Step title="Logs">
 Provides a step-by-step breakdown of the execution process
</Step>
<Step title="Details">
 Contains technical information about the workflow run
</Step>

### Understanding Each Metadata Section

#### Inputs

The Inputs tab shows exactly what data was fed into your workflow, including:

- Any keywords or text inputs
- Brand Kit selections
- File uploads
- Configuration parameters

This information helps you verify that the correct data was used for processing.

#### Logs

The Logs tab offers a comprehensive breakdown of your workflow execution:

- Each step that was executed, with timestamps
- Execution time for individual steps
- Task usage per step
- Status indicators (success or error)
- Output from each step in the workflow

Logs are particularly valuable for identifying bottlenecks or troubleshooting errors in complex workflows.

#### Details

The Details tab provides technical information about the workflow run, including:

- Status (success, error, pending)
- Version number
- Execution time and date
- Total runtime duration
- Number of tasks consumed
- Unique identifier (UUID)
- Source of execution (API, grid, manual)
- Token usage broken down by model, input, and output

### Using Metadata for Optimization

Workflow metadata helps you:

- Identify which steps are consuming the most time or resources
- Troubleshoot errors by pinpointing exactly where a workflow failed
- Monitor token usage to optimize costs
- Verify that inputs were processed as expected
- Track execution history for auditing purposes

By regularly reviewing this metadata, you can adjust your workflows for better performance, lower costs, and more reliable results.
