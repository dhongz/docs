#### 2. Configure Your Schedule

**Set the Frequency and Time**

Choose when and how often your workflow should run:

**For Daily Schedules:**

- **Frequency**: Select "Day" from the dropdown
- **Time**: Choose your preferred hour and minute (e.g., 9:00 AM)
- Workflow will run every day at the specified time

**For Weekly Schedules:**

- **Frequency**: Select "Week" from the dropdown
- **Time**: Choose your preferred hour and minute
- **Days**: Select one or more days of the week (Mon-Sun)

**For Monthly Schedules:**

- **Frequency**: Select "Month" from the dropdown

  - **Day**: Choose specific dates (1-31)
  - **Week**: Select by week of the month
  - **Month**: For broader monthly patterns

**Configure Row Filters (Optional)**

Target specific rows for your scheduled runs by adding filters:
<Steps>
<Step>
**Select a column** from the dropdown (e.g., "keyword")
</Step>
<Step>
**Choose a condition**:
   - `is not empty` - Only run on rows with data in this column
   - `is empty` - Only run on rows without data in this column
   - `contains` - Run on rows containing specific text
   - `not contains` - Exclude rows containing specific text
   - `is equal to` - Run on exact matches
   - `is not equal to` - Exclude exact matches
</Step>
<Step>
**Enter a value** for conditions that require it (contains, not contains, etc.)
</Step>
<Step>
 Click **Add Filter** to include additional conditions
</Step>
</Steps>
**Set Row Limits (Optional)**

Control the volume of each scheduled run:

- Enter a number to limit how many rows are processed per run
- Leave blank to process all matching rows
- Useful for managing workload and processing time

#### 3. Save Your Schedule

Click **Save Schedule** to activate your recurring workflow runs.

### Common Use Cases

- **Daily content refreshes** to keep information current
- **Weekly SEO monitoring** for tracking keyword performance
- **Monthly content generation** for editorial calendars

### Best Practices

#### 1. **Use Row Filters Wisely**

- Filter on empty output columns to avoid reprocessing completed rows
- Use "contains" filters to target specific content types or categories
- Combine multiple filters for precise targeting

#### 2. **Time Dependent Workflows Appropriately**

When one scheduled workflow's outputs feed into another workflow:

- Schedule them with sufficient time gaps to ensure the first completes before the second begins
- Consider the typical execution time of your workflows when setting schedules

#### 3. **Monitor Initial Runs**

- Check the History tab after your first scheduled run
- Verify that the correct rows were processed
- Adjust filters or timing as needed

- View schedule details including frequency, filters, and last run time

#### Edit or Delete Scheduled Runs
