### How to Add a Workflow Column
<Steps>
<Step title="Click the + Add Column button in your Grid"/>
<Step title="Select Workflow from the dropdown menu (it's usually the first option)"/>
<Step title="Select a workflow from the list:">
   - Search for a specific workflow using the search bar at the top
   - Browse through your published workflows
   - Note: Only published workflows will appear in this list
   - Each workflow displays with its icon and name
   - All workflows show the "Default" version by default
</Step>
<Step title="Map your Grid columns to the workflow inputs:">
   - Each required input field from your selected workflow will appear
   - For each input, select the appropriate Grid column from the dropdown
   - For Brand Kit inputs, select from your available Brand Kits
   - You can also enter static values for any field instead of mapping to a column
   - For file inputs, you can set default files that will be used across all workflow runs
   - If you need to manage Brand Kits, click the "Manage Brand Kits" link
</Step>
<Step title="Click Save to create the workflow column"/>      
<Step title="Your new workflow column will appear in the Grid:">
   - Initially shows "Click to run" for each row
   - Click the play button to run the workflow for a specific row
   - Completed runs will show a "Success" indicator
</Step>
<Step title="To adjust column mappings after creation:">      
   - Click the three dots (⋮) in the column header
   - Select **Map Workflow Inputs**
   - Remap columns as needed
   - Click **Save** to apply your changes
</Step>
<Step title="Additional workflow column options:">      
   - **Run Workflow**: Execute the workflow for a row
   - **Edit Workflow**: Open the workflow in the editor
   - **View Run History**: See past executions and results
   - **Change Version**: Select a different version of the workflow
   - **Filter**, **Hide Column**, or **Delete Column**: Manage column visibility
</Step>
</Steps>
Workflow columns create a powerful automation pipeline, allowing you to process your data with AI at scale while maintaining control over the inputs and outputs.
