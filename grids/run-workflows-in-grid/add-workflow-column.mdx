   - Each required input field from your selected workflow will appear
   - For each input, select the appropriate Grid column from the dropdown
   - For Brand Kit inputs, select from your available Brand Kits

   - If you need to manage Brand Kits, click the "Manage Brand Kits" link
</Step>
<Step title="Click Save to create the workflow column"/>      
<Step title="Your new workflow column will appear in the Grid:">

   - Click the play button to run the workflow for a specific row
   - Completed runs will show a "Success" indicator

   - Click the three dots (â‹®) in the column header
   - Select **Map Workflow Inputs**
   - Remap columns as needed
   - Click **Save** to apply your changes
</Step>

Workflow columns create a powerful automation pipeline, allowing you to process your data with AI at scale while maintaining control over the inputs and outputs.
