### Comment Counts in Grid View

When reviewing content in your Grid, you can quickly see comment activity at a glance. Each cell displays a comment count indicator showing how many comments are associated with that cell, making it easy to:

- **Identify cells with active discussions** without opening each one individually
- **Prioritize review efforts** by focusing on cells with the most feedback
- **Track collaboration progress** across your team's content review workflow

Comment counts update in real-time as team members add or resolve comments, helping you stay on top of content review and approval processes.
