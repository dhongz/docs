## Compare Content View

AirOps Grid provides a powerful content comparison feature that allows you to review, accept, or reject suggested changes to your content. This feature is particularly valuable for content optimization and quality control workflows.

## How to Set Up

**When Content Comparison is the FINAL step in your workflow**, the grid output provides an enhanced review experience:
<Steps>
<Step title="Eye Icon in HTML Column:">
 The resulting HTML column in the grid will display an eye icon (üëÅÔ∏è) next to each row
</Step>
<Step title="Interactive Diff View:">
 Clicking the eye icon opens a visual diff viewer that shows:
   - Original content with strikethrough formatting for removed text
   - New content highlighted for additions
   - A "Proposed Improvement" summary (based on your Update Instructions)
   - **Accept/Reject buttons** for last-mile human review
</Step>
</Steps>

This feature is **particularly powerful for on-page content refresh use cases**, where you need to:

- Review AI-suggested improvements to existing content
- Maintain quality control before publishing updates
- Ensure brand consistency and accuracy
- Make final accept/reject decisions with full context
