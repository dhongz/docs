### Overview

The Grid in AirOps provides powerful searching and filtering capabilities to help you quickly find and work with specific data within large datasets. These features enable you to locate content, identify patterns, and focus on relevant rows without manually scrolling through thousands of entries.

### Searching the Grid

#### How to Search

Initiate a search using either method:

- Click the **magnifying glass icon** in the top right corner of the Grid
- Use keyboard shortcuts: **Cmd+F** (Mac) or **Ctrl+F** (Windows)

#### Search Behavior

- Matching cells are **highlighted in yellow** for easy visibility
- Search works across all visible columns
- Results update in real-time as you type
- Use arrow keys to navigate between matches

### Filtering the Grid

#### Filter Options

Each column supports multiple filter conditions:

- **is equal to** - Exact match
- **is not equal to** - Exclude specific values
- **is empty** - Find blank cells
- **is not empty** - Find cells with any content
- **contains** - Partial text match
- **not contains** - Exclude partial matches

#### Using Filters
<Steps>
<Step title="Select your column from the dropdown"/>
<Step title="Choose a filter condition"/>
<Step title="Enter your filter value (if applicable)"/>
<Step title="Click `Save` to apply the filter"/>
</Steps>
Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously across different columns to create complex queries.

**Tips**

- **Save filtered views** - After applying filters, the Grid maintains your view for the session
- **Column operations** - Filtered views allow you to run operations only on visible data
</Tip>
Searching and filtering work together seamlesslyâ€”you can search within a filtered dataset to further refine your results.
