title: "Authentication"
description: "AirOps API endpoints require API keys for authentication and must be provided through a Bearer token. To authenticate your requests, include an Authorization header with the value `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`."
---

Header example: `Authorization: Bearer AIROPS_API_KEY`

Your API key can be found in the "Workspace Settings" section of your account. **Please note that your API key is a secret and should be kept confidential**, and you should never expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps) or share it with unauthorized parties.

By including this header in your API requests, you can securely access our API and ensure that only authorized users have access to your account information.

### Regenerate Key

For security reasons, it may be necessary to regenerate your API key. Regenerating your API key will invalidate the old key and provide you with a new one. This is a crucial step to maintain the security of your application if you suspect that your current API key has been compromised or if you are implementing routine security practices.

#### Considerations Before Regenerating Your API Key

1. **Immediate Effect:** As soon as you regenerate your API key, the old key will immediately cease to function. Ensure that you are ready to update your applications with the new key to avoid any service interruptions.
2. **Update Your Applications:** You must update all applications that utilize the API key. Failure to do so will result in the applications being unable to access the API.
