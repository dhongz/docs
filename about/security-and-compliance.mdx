### AirOps Security Statement

#### AI Model Providers

At AirOps, we prioritize the security of your data and take measures to ensure the highest level of protection for the data you or your users submit to us.

Our platform integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) and related services with your data while providing granular control on how that data is used. AirOps can connect directly to your data infrastructure without storing any customer data or personally identifiable information (PII) at rest.

Your data remains under your control and is never accessible to anyone outside of your AirOps workspace unless sent to a Large Language Model provider such as OpenAI, in which case it's important to review their Data Retention Policy.

#### OpenAI

OpenAI does not train on information sent via their API. Additionally, AirOps Enterprise customers benefit from OpenAI's Enterprise ZDR (Zero Data Retention) which means that submitted data is not stored, ever. Please contact us for more information.

#### General Compliance and SOC-2

AirOps is compliant with SOC2 Type 2 standards and can provide a comprehensive report upon request. Alongside our SOC2 certification, we regularly undergo security audits, infrastructure testing, and assessments to ensure our security measures are effective and up-to-date.

#### Data Connectivity Architecture

AirOps can securely and efficiently connect directly to your data warehouse and APIs when required. For data architectures within private networks, we offer the option of connecting via an SSH Tunnel to ensure enhanced security.

By connecting to your data warehouse, AirOps enables data retrieval, definition, modeling, and aggregation using SQL. We store defined datasets logically as SQL queries, which means your data remains within your architecture, and AirOps does not store customer datasets at rest.

#### AI Models in AirOps

AirOps' platform and tools incorporate AI features powered by pre-trained models accessed via third-party APIs, such as OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, and soon Google. These integrations unlock powerful use cases by combining AI capabilities with your data, workflows, and expertise.

Although AI can deliver outstanding results, it is crucial to be aware of the limitations of current models. We actively take measures to refine and improve AI-generated content; however, it may still contain biases and errors.

AirOps collaborates with model providers, the AI community, and other stakeholders to enhance safety and reliability. If you encounter any content that raises concerns, please contact [support@airops.com](mailto:support@airops.com)
