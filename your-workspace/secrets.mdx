Whenever you want to reference an API key or a secret in the Studio, you can safely add them to your workspace and make them available in the Studio in a safe manner.

In order to add a new secret, navigate to Settings > Secrets and click on "Create Secret".
<Frame>
<img src="/images/secret.avif"/>
</Frame>
Once added, you will be able to select them in the building by using this syntax:

```bash
_secrets["my_secret_name"]
```
<Frame>
<img src="/images/secret-select-name.avif"/>
</Frame>
As an example, if you add a secret named "MY\_SECRET" then you can access it in the builder as:

```bash
_secrets["MY_SECRET"]
```

For LLM credentials and other third-party integrations, AirOps usually has some native authentications, so before adding a custom secret, ensure that it is not listed in "Settings > Integrations" or "Settings > API providers".
