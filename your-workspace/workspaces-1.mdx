## Workspace Settings

Each workspace has the following unique attributes you can access by clicking ⚙️ **Settings > Workspace:**

- **Workspace ID** -- this value represents the unique ID of the selected workspace
- **API Key** -- your API key allows you to call the Sync API endpoints and allow external webhooks
- **Workspace Domain** -- you can define a URL to allow automated access for any email addresses within that domain
