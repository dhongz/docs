## What is a Workspace?

A Workspace is a unique AirOps environment. When you first sign up with AirOps, you are asked to pick a name for the Workspace. Any subsequent users you invite will be granted access to the same space for easy collaboration!
<Note>
**Note:** Creating additional Workspaces is limited to Team+ accounts

## How Do I Create a Workspace?

To get started, click on the double-arrow icon in the top-left corner of the page, next to the name of your current Workspace. From there, click the "Create Workspace" button and follow the prompt.

Once completed, that same double-arrow icon will allow you to navigate through each Workspace that you belong to.

## When should I create a new workspace?

Workspaces can be useful in a variety of scenarios. Some of the most common that we've seen include:

- Having separate "Dev" and "Production" environments for testing vs. deploying your Workflows
- Providing a Workspace for each team within your organization, e.g. a "Sales" workspace vs. "Marketing" vs. "Product"
- Personal sandboxes to avoid clutter on your company's main Workspace
