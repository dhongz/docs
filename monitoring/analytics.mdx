Under the "Analytics" tab, there are currently three built-in charts related to your Workflow usage.

1. Executions Time Series
2. Latency Time Series
3. Tasks Time Series

By default, each time series shows plots the total data across all of your Workflows. You can use the "Workflow" dropdown tab to filter the data to a specific workflow.

### Executions Time Series

The Execution Time Series (default selection) provides detailed visualization of your workflow execution performance over time.

- Track successful (blue) vs. error (pink) executions to identify potential issues and optimize reliability.
- Use time range selectors (2h, 24h, 7d, 30d) to analyze execution patterns across different periods.
- Filter by specific workflows using the dropdown menu to focus on individual workflow performance.
- The daily breakdown helps identify usage spikes and patterns, allowing for better capacity planning and troubleshooting.

### Latency Time Series

The Latency Time Series displays the time your Workflow spends in a queue vs. the actual time it spends running. You can select how you would like to see this data aggregated via the "Summarize by" dropdown tab:

Additionally, if you have already published your Workflow, you can navigate to its "Analytics" tab while viewing it. Please note that the current maximum lookback window is 3 months.
