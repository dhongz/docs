### Monitoring Task Usage

- Each workflow is displayed with metrics including average tasks per run, total tasks used, and percentage of your overall workspace consumption.
- Tracking high-consumption workflows helps you optimize task allocation and manage costs effectively.
- Use the date range selector in the top right to analyze usage patterns over specific time periods.
- The bar chart visualization gives you an immediate visual representation of task distribution across your workflows.

### Free Testing Tasks

AirOps provides free testing credits to help you build and refine production-ready workflows without consuming your regular task allocation during the development phase.

**What are Free Testing Tasks?**

- Each eligible workspace receives 50,000 free testing credits monthly
- These credits are automatically used when testing workflows via the "Test All" or "Test" step button in the Workflow Studio
- Testing credits are separate from your regular task allocation and only apply to workflow testing

**Eligible Tiers:** Free Trial, Scale, Agency

**How it Works:**

- When you click "Test All" to test your workflow or test an individual step in the Studio, the system automatically uses your free testing credits first
- Once your 50,000 testing credits are exhausted, workflow testing will consume credits from your regular task allocation
- Testing credits do not apply to production workflow runs, Grid executions, or API calls
