### Slack Action

When an alert containing a Slack action is triggered, the Slack action sends a message to the selected channel including the Workflow name, error message, and a link to the execution:

### Webhook Action

When an alert containing a Webhook action is triggered, the Webhook action sends a **POST** request to the selected url, with a **JSON** body containing metadata about the errored execution, such as Workflow, Execution id, error message, and more:

```bash
{
  "status": "error",
  "id": 72367362,
  "source": "web",
  "user_id": 9000,
  "airops_app_id": 9999,
  "output": null,
  "error_code": "SENSITIVE_CONTENT",
  "error_message": "Content contains sensitive data"
}
```
