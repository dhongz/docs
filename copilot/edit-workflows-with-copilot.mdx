## Adding Steps with Copilot

- For requests requiring new steps, Copilot can recommend adding entirely new steps to your workflow.
- By clicking the "Add Step" button when Copilot makes these suggestions, you can seamlessly incorporate new capabilities into your workflow.
- The new steps integrate smoothly with your existing workflow, ensuring existing variables and steps are referenced correctly.

## Copilot Auto-Mode

- Auto Mode lets Copilot automatically apply changes, test outputs, and make further improvements without requiring you to manually accept each suggestion.
- Copilot analyzes each step's output and continues refining until your original request is fully addressed.
- Auto Mode currently works with LLM and Code Steps, with support for additional step types expanding soon.
