    <Step>
    Make sure the variable name is also "keyword" (this happens automatically)
    </Step>
    <Step>

### Setting Up the Google Search Step

#### Step 1: Add a Google Search Step

<Steps>
<Step>
You'll need to add a Google Search step after your inputs
</Step>
<Step>
Look for the "+" button or "Add Step" option below your input node
</Step>
<Step>
Navigate through the categories and select "Web Research" category
</Step>
<Step>
Choose "Google Search" from the available steps
</Step>
<Step>
This will add a Google Search step to your workflow, similar to what's shown in Image 2
</Step>
</Steps>


#### Step 2: Configure the Google Search Step

<Steps>
<Step>
Click on the Google Search step
</Step>
<Step>
In the "Search Query" field, click on the variable explorer (pink icon on the top right of the input field) and choose `{{ keyword }}`
</Step>
<Step>
Leave the "Search Parameters" field empty for now
</Step>
<Step>
Save your configuration
</Step>
</Steps>

### Creating the LLM Analysis Step

#### Step 1: Add a Prompt LLM Step

<Steps>
<Step>
After your Google Search step, add another step
</Step>
<Step>
Choose "Prompt LLM" (Large Language Model) from the available steps
</Step>
<Step>
This will add an LLM step after your Google Search step
</Step>
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure the LLM Model

<Steps>
<Step>
Click on the LLM step
</Step>
<Step>
We're using "GPT-4o" as our model in this example
</Step>
<Step>
You can leave other settings at their defaults for now
</Step>
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Craft Your LLM Prompt

<Steps>
<Step>
In the LLM step panel, enter the following prompt in the input field that says "User" on its left:

```text expandable
You are tasked with analyzing the themes and best practices of top-performing Google search results for a given keyword. This analysis will help understand what makes these pages successful and provide insights for content creation.

The keyword for analysis is:
{{ keyword }}

Here are the top-performing results from Google for this keyword:
{{ step_1.output }}

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Carefully read through all the top-performing results.

2. Analyze the themes:
   a. Identify common topics or subjects addressed across multiple results.
   b. Note any unique angles or perspectives on the main topic.
   c. Observe the depth and breadth of information covered.

3. Identify best practices:
   a. Examine the content structure (headings, subheadings, lists, etc.).
   b. Assess the use of media (images, videos, infographics, etc.).
   c. Evaluate the writing style and tone.
   d. Look for patterns in content length and detail level.
   e. Note any common external resources or references used.
   f. Observe how the content addresses user intent.

4. Present your analysis in the following format:

# Analysis
## Themes
[List and briefly describe 3-5 main themes you've identified]

## Best Practices
[List and explain 5-7 best practices you've observed]

## Recommendations
[Provide 3-5 actionable recommendations for creating content based on your analysis]

Remember to be thorough in your analysis and objective in your observations. Focus on patterns and practices that appear to contribute to the success of these top-performing pages. Your insights should be valuable for anyone looking to create high-quality content on this topic.
```

</Step>
<Step>
Notice how this prompt references both the keyword input (`{{ keyword }}`) and the output from the previous Google Search step (`{{ step_1.output }}`)
</Step>
</Steps>

### Testing and Publishing Your Workflow

#### Step 1: Test Your Workflow

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Click "Test Workflow" in the top right of the Studio navigation bar (play icon next to it)
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Enter a test keyword (e.g., "content marketing tips" or "best running shoes")
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click "Test Workflow" to run your workflow
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Review the results to ensure both steps are working correctly
    </Step>
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Publish Your Workflow

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Look for a "Publish" button on the top right of the Studio
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Give your workflow a descriptive name like "Keyword SERP Researcher"
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Add a brief description of what the workflow does
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Publish your workflow to make it available for running
