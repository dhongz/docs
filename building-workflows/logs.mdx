### What are Workflow Logs?

Workflow Logs provide a detailed, step-by-step record of everything that happens during a workflow execution. They capture the complete journey of your data through each step of your workflow, including:

- **Step execution details**: Runtime duration, success/failure status, and number of tasks processed
- **Input and output data**: The exact data that went into each step and what came out
- **Metadata**: Information about who ran the workflow, when it was executed, and from what source
- **Error messages**: Detailed error information when steps fail, helping you identify and fix issues

### Why Logs Matter for Your Workflows

- **Understand workflow behavior**: See exactly what data flows into and out of each step
- **Debug failed executions**: Identify where and why workflows fail with detailed error messages
- **Optimize performance**: Find bottlenecks by reviewing step execution times
- **Iterate without re-running**: Load any past execution into Studio with all outputs intact

### Where to Find Logs

- **Studio Testing Mode**: Click on the History icon on the top right of the Studio to view the Logs that workflow's executions
- **Workflow History**: Access all past executions via the "History" tab in your workflow
- **Grid Workflow Columns**: Click any cell in the workflow column to view logs for that specific row's run

### Loading Executions into Studio

The **"Open in Studio"** button lets you load any previous workflow execution back into the Studio with all step outputs restored. This powerful feature enables you to:

<Steps>
<Step>
    Debug issues without re-running the entire workflow
</Step>
<Step>
    Test changes using real data from actual executions
</Step>
<Step>
    Skip waiting for external API calls or long-running processes
</Step>
<Step>
    Iterate on prompts and logic with production data
</Step>
</Steps>

To use it: Simply click "Open in Studio" from any execution's log view. The Studio will load with all intermediate outputs populated, allowing you to modify and test any step immediately.

This is especially valuable for debugging complex workflows, working with time-sensitive data, or collaborating on workflow improvements.

### Best Practices for Using Logs

1. **Use Descriptive Step Names**: Give your steps clear, descriptive names to make logs easier to navigate and understand
2. **Monitor Execution Times**: Keep an eye on step durations to catch performance degradation early

By leveraging the full power of Logs, you can build more reliable workflows, debug issues faster, and continuously improve your automation processes.
