## What are Power Agents?

Power Agents are pre-built, reusable workflow components designed to accelerate your content operations in AirOps. Think of them as expertly crafted building blocks that encapsulate best practices for common marketing and SEO tasks. Each Power Agent is a tested, optimized mini-workflow that performs a specific function—from keyword research to content creation to optimization tasks.

Rather than building workflows from scratch, Power Agents allow you to leverage proven processes that our team and community have refined through hundreds of iterations.

## Where to Find Power Agents

You can access Power Agents in two ways:

### 1. Within the Workflow Studio

When building a workflow, click the **"Power Agents"** tab at the top of the step selector panel. Power Agents are organized into categories:

- **Content Research** - Analyze SERPs, cluster keywords, identify opportunities
- **Content Planning** - Create briefs, research products, plan content strategy
- **Content Creation** - Generate articles, add links, create meta tags
- **Content Refresh** - Research competitive gaps, improve existing content

## Forking Power Agents
<Note>
**Note:**

This feature is currently available as an add-on on Enterprise tier plans.
</Note>

Forking allows you to create a customized version of any Power Agent. This is useful when you want to:

- Modify the underlying prompts to match your brand voice
- Adjust the logic for your specific use case
- Add or remove steps from the workflow
- Create variations for different content types

### Best Practices

- **Start with Power** Agents - Before building custom workflows, check if a Power Agent already exists for your use case
- **Chain Power** Agents - Many Power Agents are designed to work together (e.g., "Create Content Brief from Keyword" → "Create Article from Content Brief")
- **Review outputs** - Power Agents include quality control mechanisms, but always review outputs before publishing
- **Monitor costs** - Check the task cost in the details view to understand resource usage before running at scale

Power Agents are continuously updated based on user feedback and performance data, ensuring you always have access to the most effective workflows for your content operations.
