With the Human Review step, the user can be prompted to review, validate, and edit a text value (*Single Item*) or select and edit multiple values (*Multiple Values*) before continuing a workflow.

For example, you could create a list of 5 blog titles for a user to select from, ask the user to review and select the titles to publish with a review step, and finally publish the selected content to your blog.

## Review a Single Item

### What is a Single Item?

The single item allows the user to edit the text from a single-line text box:

<Frame caption="Single Item Review">

</Frame>

### How to Configure a Single Item

1. **Label the item:** the label will automatically create the variable name associated with your label. In the example below, we label our item "Blog Title", which also created the variable `blog_title`
2. **Assign the value of the item:** use Liquid syntax to pass the value that you want the user to edit and review. In the example below, this is `{{step_2.output}}`
3. **(Optional) Notify a Slack channel:** choose a Slack channel which will notify users to review the output

## Review Multiple Values

### What is are Multiple Values?

Multiple values allow the user to select and edit multiple values at once:

### How to Configure Multiple Values

1. Set up a list of options:
	1. **Generate a list:** use an LLM step to generate a list of items, it must be an Array

        <Frame caption="A list of 5 blog titles">
        ![](/images/building-workflows/flow/generate-a-list.png)
        </Frame>
	2. **Label the item:** the label will automatically create the variable name associated with your label. In the example below, we label our item "Blog Titles", which also created the variable `blog_titles`
	3. **Assign the value of the item:** use Liquid syntax to pass the list you generated in Step 1. In the example below, this is `{{step_2.output}}`
	4. **(Optional) Notify a Slack channel:** choose a Slack channel which will notify users to review the output

## Referencing the Human Review Step

### How to Reference a Single Item

To reference a single item from the Human Review step, use the variable corresponding to the label you provided.

In this example, we named the item "Blog Title" which created the variable `{{step_3.output.blog_title}}` :

</Frame>

### How to Reference Multiple Values

To reference multiple values from the Human Review step, use the variable corresponding to the label you provided.

However, unlike referencing a single item, the output of a multiple value review is a list:

![](/images/building-workflows/flow/reference-multiple-values.png)
</Frame>

In other words, `{{step_3.output.blog_titles}}` from the example above gives the user a list of blog titles. If you want to reference only the first blog title, you would need to modify your syntax to `{{step_3.output.blog_titles[0]}}`.

## Review Session

When a workflow reaches the review step, it pauses the execution, leaves the workflow in a pending state for review, and creates a review session where the user can review the content.

### How to Review Output

- **For single items,** you can edit the content using *markdown* syntax.
- **For multiple values,** you can edit the values and select/unselect them.
- After editing you can either choose to accept the reviewed content, or cancel the execution.

### Review in the Test Panel

As you test your workflow, you can access the review session by clicking on "Review":

### Review in Real-Time when Running Once

When you Run Once, the review session will automatically appear, and your user can review the outputs in real-time:

### Review Asynchronously in the History

To review executions asynchronously, you can review them in the **History** tab:

<Steps>
<Step title="Click on History to view all executions"/>
<Step title="Filter the Status to Review needed"/>
<Step title="Click on View in the Actions column"/>
<Step title="Click on Review to review the output and continue the execution"/>
</Steps>
