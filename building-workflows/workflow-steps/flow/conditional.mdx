## Condition Step

The Condition Step allows you to create branching logic in your workflows, executing different steps based on whether a specified condition evaluates to `True` or `False`.

### What is a Condition Step?

A Condition Step acts as a decision point in your workflow, directing the flow based on a JavaScript expression that you define. It consists of:

1. **The Condition**: A JavaScript expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`
2. **True Path**: Steps that execute when the condition evaluates to `True` (left branch)
3. **False Path**: Steps that execute when the condition evaluates to `False` (right branch)

### How to Configure a Condition Step

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Click the "+" button to add a new step in your workflow
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Select "Flow" from the categories, then choose "Condition"
    </Step>
    <Step>
    In the configuration panel, enter your JavaScript condition
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Add steps to both the True and False paths as needed
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Condition Expression Syntax

Conditions are written as JavaScript expressions that evaluate to a boolean value. You can:

- Use comparison operators: `>, <, >=, <=, ===, !==`
- Apply logical operators: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)
- Use conditional (ternary) operators: `condition ? trueValue : falseValue`
- Access nested properties: `step_2.output.results[0].score > 80`

### Common Use Cases

- **Content branching**: Generate different content types based on user input
- **Error handling**: Take alternative actions when a step fails
- **Quality control**: Route content through additional steps if it doesn't meet quality thresholds

### Example

```javascript
// If the keyword has high search volume, use a more detailed research approach
step_2.output.search_volume > 5000
```

This condition will route the workflow through the True path for high-volume keywords and the False path for lower-volume keywords, allowing you to optimize your research process for each scenario.

### Best Practices

- **Keep conditions simple**: Complex logic is harder to debug and maintain
- **Provide default paths**: Ensure both True and False paths are configured
- **Use descriptive names**: Rename your condition steps to describe their purpose (e.g., "Check Search Volume")
- **Test thoroughly**: Verify both paths work as expected with different inputs

Condition Steps are powerful tools for creating adaptable workflows that respond intelligently to different scenarios and data conditions.
