Web Research Steps allow you to automate information gathering that would typically require manual browsing and copying. By programmatically accessing search results and website content, you can build workflows that continuously monitor topics, gather competitive intelligence, compile research for content creation, and maintain up-to-date information without manual intervention.

These steps can be combined with other AirOps capabilities like LLM Steps to analyze search results, extract key insights, and transform raw web content into structured, actionable information.
