### How to Configure the Scan Content for Plagiarism Step

- **Content**: Input the content you'd like to analyze
- **Domain to Exclude (optional)**: Enter a URL to exclude from the analysis. This is typically your domain given that there is a high likelihood of content overlap between this content and your domain's existing content.

### Output Format
