The "Google Search" Step allows you to automate a Google Search and pass the results as input into your Workflows.

## Configuring a "Google Search" Step

Configuring the step requires setting the three different parameters shown below:

</Frame>

### Search Query

The "Search Query" input field is the exact phrase that will be Googled when the step runs, i.e. what do you want to search in Google?

<Info>
To search from a specific site, you can type **site:www.example.com** followed by your search phrase
</Info>

### Search Parameters

To narrow down the results of your search, you can configure specific parameters based on the [SERP API documentation](https://serpapi.com/search-api):

For example:

- Search within a specific region
- Limit the number of results returned
- Enable or disable similar/omitted results

When filtering by one or multiple parameters, it is important that you format them as JSON. Similarly, the expected output of the Google Search Step will be formatted as JSON, as shown in the example below.

To dynamically set variables as query or search parameters referencing an input (defined in the "Start" step) or output variable ( generated by any step), you will need to use Liquid syntax:

    style={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '100%', aspectRatio: '1.5 / 1', height: '100%', border: 'none'}}
></iframe>
</Frame>

### Output Types

The following Output Types are currently supported by the "Google Search" Step:
