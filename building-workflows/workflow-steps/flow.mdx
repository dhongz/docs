</Columns>

Flow Steps act as the decision-making framework for your workflows, allowing you to implement complex business logic, quality control checkpoints, and fallback mechanisms. By combining these steps, you can create workflows that respond intelligently to different scenarios, process large datasets efficiently, and maintain quality through human oversight.

Use Condition steps to route your workflow based on data values, Iteration steps to process lists of items, Human Review steps to ensure quality through manual checks, Content Comparison steps to highlight differences between content versions, and Error steps to gracefully handle exceptions with user-friendly messages.

**Note:**

Flow Steps are primarily designed for Workflow applications. Some steps may have limited functionality when used in Agents.
