AEO Research Steps provide comprehensive analytics to track your brand's visibility across AI platforms, helping you optimize content strategy for the AI-powered search landscape.

## What is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of optimizing your content to appear prominently in AI-generated responses from platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, or Google AI Mode. Unlike traditional SEO which focuses on ranking in search results, AEO ensures your brand gets mentioned and cited when users ask questions across various AI platforms.

**Key differences from traditional SEO:**

|Traditional SEO|Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)|
| :--- | :---|
| Ranks pages in search results | Gets your brand mentioned in AI answers |
| Focuses on keywords and backlinks | Emphasizes authoritative content and citations |
| Targets search engine algorithms | Optimizes for LLM training data and real-time retrieval |
| Measures clicks and impressions | Tracks mention rates and sentiment |


## Available Research Steps

### 1\. AEO Data Step

**Get historical brand visibility analytics across AI platforms**

Analyze your brand's performance in AI-generated responses with three complementary report types that provide actionable insights for content strategy and competitive positioning:

- **Mentions Report**: Track your brand's share of voice compared to competitors with sentiment analysis. Shows what percentage of total brand mentions belong to each company, plus average sentiment scores from -1.0 (negative) to 1.0 (positive).
- **Citations Report**: Identify which URLs are most frequently referenced by AI platforms as authoritative sources. Reveals which content gets cited in responses that include source references, helping you understand what AI considers authoritative in your industry.
- **Answers Report**: Review actual AI-generated response content to see exactly how your brand is positioned and described. Access up to 28 recent responses (truncated at 10,000 characters when needed) to analyze messaging consistency and competitive framing.

**Supported AI Platforms:**

- Open AI ChatGPT
- Perplexity AI
- Google Gemini
- Anthropic Claude

**Data aggregation**: Results are combined across all AI providers by default for unified insights rather than platform-specific metrics. You can optionally filter to specific providers (e.g., ChatGPT, Perplexity).
