The Google Docs integration allows you to create a Doc within the connected Drive account.

## Authentication

Before using the Google Docs integration, you need to authenticate your Google account with AirOps. This integration requires specific permissions to create and manage Google Docs documents in Google Drive.

### Multiple Google Accounts

AirOps supports connecting multiple Google accounts within the same workspace. This allows you to:

- Create documents in different Google Drive accounts
- Manage permissions across multiple Google organizations
- Switch between personal and business accounts

Each authenticated account appears as a separate connector that you can select when configuring your workflow step.

### Required Permissions

The Google Docs integration requires the following OAuth 2.0 scopes:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` - Create and manage files in Google Drive created by AirOps
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents` - Create and edit Google Docs

### How to Authenticate

Before using Google Docs in your workflows, you need to set up the integration in your workspace settings:

1. **Set up the Integration**
	- Go to **Settings > Integrations** (or visit `/account/integrations`)
	- Click **Add New** to create a new authentication
	- Select **Google Docs** from the provider list
2. **Complete OAuth Flow**
	- Click **Authenticate** to begin the Google OAuth process
	- Sign in with your Google account
	- Grant the requested permissions to AirOps
	- You'll be redirected back to AirOps with successful authentication
3. **Use in Workflows**
	- Navigate to your workflow and add the Google Docs step
	- Select your authenticated Google account from the dropdown
	- Configure the document parameters

<Info>
**Multiple Accounts:**

If you have multiple Google accounts authenticated, you'll see a dropdown to select which account to use for each workflow step. Each authentication is available across all workflows in your workspace.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
