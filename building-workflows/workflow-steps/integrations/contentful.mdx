## Authentication

        <Step>
        Log in to your Contentful account.
        </Step>
        <Step>

        <Step>
        Press the "Create Personal Access To" button.
        </Step>
        <Step>
        Provide a descriptive name for the token to identify its usage easily.
        </Step>
        <Step>
        After the token is generated, make sure to copy and securely store it immediately, as it will not be displayed again.
        </Step>
    </Steps>
2. **Add the Personal Access Token to Your Workflow:**

    <Steps>

        Find the section for Contentful integration and click on the "Configure" button.

        <Step>
        Click "Add" to complete the setup.
        </Step>
    </Steps>

**Security Note:**

Treat your Personal Access Token like a password. It provides full access to your Contentful space, and it should not be shared. Store it securely and only use it in server-side or secure, authenticated environments.
