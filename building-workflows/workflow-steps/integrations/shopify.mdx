You can access the Shopify data in subsequent workflow steps using Liquid syntax. For example:

To access a created article's ID:

```bash
Copy{{ step_2.output.article.id }}
```

To loop through a list of products in an LLM prompt:

```bash
Copy{% for product in step_2.output.products %}

{% endfor %}
```

## Error Handling

By default, the Shopify Integration step will terminate the workflow if it fails. You can configure it to continue by selecting "Continue" instead of "Terminate Workflow" in the step settings.
