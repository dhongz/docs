Analytics Integrations enable you to build workflows that automatically respond to performance data, create reporting systems that combine analytics with AI-powered insights, and implement data-driven content optimization strategies.

By connecting your analytics platforms with AirOps, you can automate processes like identifying underperforming content for optimization, monitoring keyword rankings to inform content strategy, and generating regular performance reports with contextual analysis.

**Note:**

Analytics Integrations require appropriate access credentials for each platform. Authentication typically requires admin-level permissions to the connected analytics account
