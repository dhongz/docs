Data Steps form the connective tissue between your workflows and your organization's knowledge repositories. They enable workflows to access relevant information, learn from past executions, and contribute new insights back to your knowledge ecosystem.

These steps are particularly valuable for creating workflows that maintain context over time, building self-improving systems, and ensuring consistent access to the most current information across your organization. By combining Data Steps with other AirOps capabilities, you can create workflows that not only process information but also continuously enhance your organization's collective intelligence.
