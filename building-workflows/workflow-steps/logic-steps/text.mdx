## How does the Text Step work?

The Text Step allows users to concatenate the outputs of previous steps into a single string. It's most often used as the final step in your workflow to ensure your final output is structured exactly the way you would like.

Text Steps are also a great option for extracting multiple values stored in lists or arrays that you may want to concatenate into a single string.

## How to Configure a Text Step?

The most basic implementation of a Text Step is straightforward. You simply need to reference the desired variables or step outputs using Liquid syntax, as shown below:

<Frame caption="Call your previous steps together">
![](/images/building-workflows/code/configure-text-step.png)
</Frame>

In this example, our Text Step is concatenating Step 10 (generating a title) with Step 9 (generating the article content). So, our end result is a properly formatted article with the title followed by the body.

## Concatenating the Output of an Iteration Step

One of the more popular use-cases for a Text Step is to extract values from an Iteration Step. The general formatting for this is:

```bash
{% for chunk in step_x.output %}
{{chunk}}
{% endfor %}
```

with "step\_x" representing your Iteration Step, and the "chunk" being the values we want to pull. Let's take a look at another example:

<Frame caption="Concatenate values pulled from the Iteration Step">
![](/images/building-workflows/code/concatenate-iteration-step.png)
</Frame>

This is pulled directly from our "Article Merge" template. Out Iteration Step (step\_12) checks to see whether it is writing an introduction for our article or if it is writing the body of the article. By calling our Text Step as:

```bash
{% for chunk in step_12.output %}
{{ chunk }}
{% endfor %}
```

We are effectively combining the results of each piece into a single string.
