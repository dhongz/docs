### How to Configure the Group Keywords into Clusters Step

- **Keywords**: List of keywords to be clustered as a JSON array (i.e. \["keyword a", "keyword b"\]
- **Clustering Sensitivity**: Choose how sensitive you want the clustering logic to be:
	- Low = lower number of clusters (more coarse clustering)
	- High = higher number of clusters (more fine clustering)

### Output Format

The Group Keywords into Clusters step returns a JSON object containing the organized keyword clusters:

```json expandable
