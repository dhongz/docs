Code Steps enable users to add more traditional automation into Workflows. If you're looking for a way to recreate common behavior across coding languages, then the following steps likely hold your answer:

<Card title="Run Code" icon="code" href="/building-workflows/workflow-steps/logic-steps/code">
Apply custom Python or Javascript code to transform data or add complex logic
</Card>
<Card title="Call API" icon="code" href="/building-workflows/workflow-steps/logic-steps/api">
Make HTTP requests to external APIs and services
</Card>
<Card title="Format JSON" icon="code" href="/building-workflows/workflow-steps/logic-steps/json">
Structure the output of your Workflow as valid JSON for easier consumption
</Card>
<Card title="Run SQL Query" icon="code" href="/building-workflows/workflow-steps/logic-steps/sql-query">
Execute queries against your connected databases
</Card>
<Card title="Write Liquid Text" icon="code" href="/building-workflows/workflow-steps/logic-steps/text">
Create text templates with dynamic variable substitution
</Card>
</Columns>

Code Steps provide the flexibility and power needed to handle complex data transformations, integrate with external services, and implement custom logic that goes beyond what's possible with pre-built steps. Whether you need to parse complex data structures, perform mathematical calculations, or connect to specialized APIs, Code Steps give you the tools to accomplish these tasks within your workflows.
