## How to Configure the Read from Grid Step

### Select a Grid

Choose the specific Grid you want to import data from. The dropdown will show all available Grids in your workspace.

### Filtering Options

You can optionally filter the rows you want to import from the selected Grid:

- **All Rows**: Import all rows from the selected Grid
- **Selected Rows**: Import only specific rows based on your criteria

### Column Selection

Choose which columns from the Grid you want to import:

- **All Columns**: Import all columns from the selected Grid
- **Selected Columns**: Specify only certain columns to import

## Output Format

The Read from Grid step outputs data in a structured format that can be easily used in subsequent steps of your workflow. The output will be an array of objects, with each object representing a row from the Grid.

Example output:

```json
[
  {
    "column1": "value1",
    "column2": "value2",
    "column3": "value3"
  },
  {
    "column1": "value4",
    "column2": "value5",
    "column3": "value6"
  }
]
```
