### What is the Add Rows in Grid Step?

The Add Rows in Grid step is **specifically designed to create or update separate rows** in an AirOps Grid beyond the current row where your workflow is running. This is different from simply mapping outputs to columns in your current Grid row.

<Warning>
**Important Distinction**:

If you just want to map workflow outputs as columns in the current Grid row where your workflow is running, you **do not need** the Add Rows in Grid step. Instead, use a JSON step at the end of your workflow.
</Warning>

### When to Use Add Rows in Grid vs. JSON Step for Grid Outputs

#### Use a JSON Step (Not Add Rows in Grid) When:

- You simply want to map workflow outputs to columns in the **same row** where your workflow is running
- You want to organize multiple output values into a structured format
- You're running a workflow in a Grid and want to see results in that same row

```text
Example: Your workflow generates a title, content, and meta description.You want these to appear as columns in your Grid next to your inputs.
```

#### Use the Add Rows in Grid Step Only When:

- You need to create entirely new rows in a separate Grid or in the same Grid
- You want to update existing rows in another Grid

```text
Example: Your workflow analyzes one keyword but generates 10 related keywords,each needing its own row in a separate Grid for further processing.
```

### How to Map Outputs in a Grid (Without Add Rows in Grid)

<Steps>
<Step title="Add a JSON step as the final step in your workflow"/>
<Step title="Structure your outputs as key-value pairs"/>
<Step title="When you run the workflow in a Grid, these keys will automatically be available to map as output columns"/>
<Step title= 'Select "Add Outputs as Columns" in the Grid interface after running'/>
</Steps>

### How to Configure the Add Rows in Grid Step (For Creating/Updating Separate Rows)

When you actually need to create or update separate rows beyond your current workflow row:

#### Select a Grid

Choose the Grid where you want to write your data:

- **Create a New Grid**: Generate a new Grid to store your data
- **Select Existing Grid**: Add data to an already existing Grid

#### Output Mapping

Define how the data from your workflow should be mapped to columns in the separate Grid:

- **Column Names**: Define the names of the columns in your target Grid
- **Values**: Select which workflow step outputs should populate each column

#### Write Mode

Choose how your data should be written to the Grid:

- **Append**: Add new rows to the existing Grid data
- **Replace**: Clear existing Grid data and replace it with the new data
- **Update**: Update specific rows in the Grid based on a key column

By understanding the distinction between simple output mapping (JSON step) and creating separate rows (Add Rows in Grid step), you'll be able to build more efficient and effective workflows.
