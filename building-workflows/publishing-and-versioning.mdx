Versioning allows you to easily manage historic instances, drafts, and published default versions of your Workflows.

## What is the difference between a draft, a version, and a default version?

1. **Drafts** are not saved permanently, and only the latest draft is saved.
2. **Versions** on the other hand are permanently saved. They can always be viewed and restored. You can also run versions of Workflows as a batch, API, or add them to another workflow or agent
3. The **Default Version** is the version of the Workflow that:
	1. Users interact with in the AirOps UI
	2. Runs when you call the Execute POST endpoint, unless another version is passed in as a parameter

## How do I create a new version?

When you're ready to share, integrate, or run your Workflow, publish it into a permanent version by clicking "**Publish Workflow"** in the top right-hand corner:

<Frame>
![](/images/building-workflows/how-do-i-create-new-version.png)
</Frame>

This generates "Version 1" of your Workflow, which now acts as the Default Version.

## What happens to my previous version if I publish again?

All previously published versions are permanently saved, and a new version becomes the Default version.

## Utilizing Previous Versions

To view the previous versions of your Workflow, simply click on the **"Versions"** dropdown and select the desired version:

<Frame>
![](/images/building-workflows/using-previous-version.png)
</Frame>

<Info>
Your draft will NOT be overwritten by simply clicking on a previous version.
</Info>

### Restoring previous versions as a draft

To restore a previous version to your current draft, start by selecting your desired historical version from the dropdown, then hitting **"Restore."**

<Info>
Your current draft WILL be overwritten by clicking **"Restore,"** so be sure you don't have any changes that could be lost.
</Info>

<Frame>
![](/images/building-workflows/restoring-prev-version-as-draft.png)
</Frame>

This promotes your historic version into the current draft, which you can then choose to save or publish.

### Set previous versions as the Default Version

To restore a previous version to be your Default Version, start again by selecting your desired historical version from the dropdown, then hitting **"Set Default."**

<Frame>
![](/images/building-workflows/set-previous-version-as-default.png)
</Frame>

When you change the default version, only the version in production is changed. The latest draft does NOT change.

## Referencing Versions through the API

Once you have multiple versions of your Workflow, you can specify which specific version to execute via the AirOps API.

To do this, navigate back to the display window of your Workflow, and click on the **"Integrate"** tab at the top:

The general POST command will always run against the Default Version, while the Versioning endpoint allows you to specify the desired version to execute.
