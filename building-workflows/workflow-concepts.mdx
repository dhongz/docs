AirOps workflows are built on four key concepts that work together to create powerful automation for your marketing and content needs. Understanding these basics will help you build effective workflows quickly.

- **Workflow Inputs**: The information you feed into your workflow when you start it - like text, files, or selections from dropdown menus. Think of these as the raw materials for your workflow to process.
- **Workflow Steps**: The actions your workflow performs - such as generating text with AI, searching Google, generating an image, or reviewing content. These steps are connected in sequence to accomplish your goal.
- **Workflow Variables**: Values that can be passed between different parts of your workflow. Variables let you use the output from one step as input for another, creating a connected chain of actions.
- **Workflow Outputs**: The final results your workflow produces - whether that's a blog post, image, analysis, or data in a specific format. This is what gets delivered when your workflow finishes running.
