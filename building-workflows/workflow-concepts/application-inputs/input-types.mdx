### Basic Input Types

Basic input types allow users to type information or select options from a dropdown:

- **Short Text:** A single-line text field
- **Long Text:** A multi-line text field
- **Single Select:** Allows the user to choose one option from a list
- **Multi Select:** Allows the user to choose multiple options from a list

### Advanced Input Types

Advanced input types allow users to pass in JSON, files, databases, or numbers as inputs:

<Danger>
Workflows with file inputs cannot be published as public Workflows
</Danger>

- **JSON:** Allows the user to pass a JSON object or list
- **File Text:** Allows the user to upload a .pdf, .txt, .docx, .md file that is converted into text
- **File Media:** Allows the user to upload a .mp3, .mp4, .wav, .jpg, .png, .webp file which is converted into a downloadable link
- **File CSV:** Allows the user to upload a .csv file which is transformed into a list of JSON objects

<Tip>
**Default File Values:** When running workflows in a Grid, you can set default files for file inputs that will be used across all workflow runs, eliminating the need to upload the same file repeatedly.
</Tip>
- **Data Sources:** Allows the user to connect to a [data source](/your-data/memory-stores/add-data/import-from-sql-database/data-sources) that has been added in AirOps
- **Number:** Allows the user to pass a numerical string that is interpreted as a number instead of a string

<Warning>
**Warning:**

If you input a number using Short Text or Long Text, it will be interpreted as a string - e.g. 3 will be interpreted as "3". Instead, use the **Number** input type to pass a number.
</Warning>

### AirOps-Specific Input Types

AirOps-specific input types provide access to additional platform features:

- **Brand Kit:** Allows you to choose a brand kit as an input and reference any of its attributes throughout the workflow
	- **Example:** An article writing workflow that automatically adapts content style, tone, and messaging according to different brand guidelines (e.g., creating the same type of content for multiple client brands while maintaining each brand's unique voice)
- **Knowledge Base:** Allows you to dynamically set a knowledge base upfront and reference it throughout the workflow
	- **Example:** An internal linking workflow that recommends relevant page connections based on different sitemaps, allowing content teams to optimize SEO by connecting related content across various sections of a website
