### Basic Input Types

Basic input types allow users to type information or select options from a dropdown:

- **Short Text:** A single-line text field
- **Long Text:** A multi-line text field
- **Single Select:** Allows the user to choose one option from a list
- **Multi Select:** Allows the user to choose multiple options from a list

### Advanced Input Types

Advanced input types allow users to pass in JSON, files, databases, or numbers as inputs:

- **JSON:** Allows the user to pass a JSON object or list
- **File Text:** Allows the user to upload a .pdf, .txt, .docx, .md file that is converted into text
- **File Media:** Allows the user to upload a .mp3, .mp4, .wav, .jpg, .png, .webp file which is converted into a downloadable link
- **File CSV:** Allows the user to upload a .csv file which is transformed into a list of JSON objects
- **Data Sources:** Allows the user to connect to a [data source](/your-data/memory-stores/add-data/import-from-sql-database/data-sources) that has been added in AirOps
- **Number:** Allows the user to pass a numerical string that is interpreted as a number instead of a string

<Warning>
**Warning:**

If you input a number using Short Text or Long Text, it will be interpreted as a string - e.g. 3 will be interpreted as "3". Instead, use the **Number** input type to pass a number.
</Warning>

### AirOps-Specific Input Types

- **Knowledge Base:** Allows you to dynamically set a knowledge base upfront and reference it throughout the workflow
	- **Example:** An internal linking workflow that recommends relevant page connections based on different sitemaps, allowing content teams to optimize SEO by connecting related content across various sections of a website
