How to Add Input Variables

Workflow Inputs are variables you can set at runtime and use inside of your Workflows.

### 1\. Click the **"Configure"** button on your Start step

<Frame caption="Click on 'Set Inputs' to define your inputs">

</Frame>

### 2\. Select your input type

You will be prompted to first choose your desired **"Input Type."** This determines both the user interface and the data type of your input value:

</Frame>

### 3\. Customize the input field

See the [next section](/building-workflows/workflow-concepts/application-inputs#input-types) for a full list of supported types to decide what works best for your use-case. Continue to populate the remaining fields of your Workflow Input:

</Frame>

- **Label:** a descriptive label for the name of your input
- **Variable Name:** the name of your input as a variable, which will be referenced as liquid syntax in your steps. By default, the variable name is automatically generated when you add a label, but it can be customized to be separate
- **Hint:** helper text that appears below your input on the Workflow page
- **Placeholder:** example value that will be overwritten by your input value
- **Default Value:** a default value used if no other input value is provided, this is useful for API calls
- **Required:** determines whether or not the input is required for your Workflow to run successfully
